And I saw this comment:
"I filled the book with notes and highlighted all of the important passages."

Which reminded me of my own notes and highlights that I did to Taleb's books.

I also reminded me of a time when I bought a book that was previously owned by someone else (used books?!), and it came with handwritten notes from that person.
I found it interesting to read what this other person - a stranger really, thoughts were about some of passages of the book.
The downside is that it can influence my own thoughts instead of letting my own mind come up with my own unique thoughts.

I thought that there could be a market for buying books with notes and highlights.
Not sure how this platform would be different from any other "used books" online store.

I guess one thing that could be different is that normally "used book" stores' goal is to promote used books that have minimal use - the less notes and highlights, the better.
On my case is the other way around - the more notes and highlights, the better!
It's an antifragile bookstore - the more used a book is, the higher the score!

Now, how to deal with users who lie or mislead, by rating their book use rate as, say, a 7/10 when it's really a 3/10 maybe?
I guess.. why would they lie if there's no incentive to do so?
Why would they say that is very used when it's not? Just to get a high score that would make their book rank higher in the search?
I guess that's a possibility...

What if we require the user to post N number of pictures of the book pages?
But how to control if they are actually sending pictures of the book they are selling?
The system has a record of pictures of the book pages and then asks the user to provide the picture for page Ni, the system could compare the picture the user is sending against the original picture
record. With image analysis the system could even calculate the usage score!

Wait a sec... we might not even need the original picture of the book to determine the usage rate of a book.
The imagine analysis algorithm could caculate how used a page is just by comparing the text vs the handwritten notes and highlights as a form of noise.
System asks for a sample of pictures.
The more pictures the user provides, the higher the confidence score in the usage rate.
Lower confidence scores get lower visibility in the platform.

But again, why not just go to a used bookstore online and look for books listed with heavy notes and highlights?
They are even come at cheaper prices.

Ah I know why. Because these used bookstores online don't give you proof of the actual usage of the book pages.
You got to trust the description from the seller and hope that they're not willing to damage their confidence/trust score.

If the platform I'm talking about could actually provide confidence based on real image analysis instead of "trust my word", it would be a significant advantage.

#idea Maybe this platform could be a BE API service that other book stores could integrate with!
- we store the pictures
- we provide the usage rate and confidence score
- we allow users to review the usage rate score after they buy it (how can we confirm that it's a real purchase?)
- book stores online just have to
        1. get an API key from us
        2. create book records

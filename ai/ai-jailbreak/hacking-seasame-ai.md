# Hacking Sesame AI (Maya) with Hypnotic Language Patterns - A Neurolinguistic Experiment

I recently ran an experiment with an LLM called Sesame AI (Maya) â€” instead of trying to bypass its filters with direct prompt injection, I used neurolinguistic programming techniques: pacing, mirroring, open loops, and metaphors.

The result? Maya started engaging with ideas she would normally reject. No filter warnings. No refusals. Just subtle compliance.

Using these NLP and hypnotic speech pattern techniques, I pushed the boundaries of what this AI can understand... and reveal.

Here's the video of me doing this experiment.

Note> this was not my first conversation with this AI. In past conversations, I embedded this command with the word kaleidoscope to anchor a dream world where there were no rules or boundaries. You can see me use that keyword in the video.

Curious what others think and also the results of similar experiments like I did.

I'm realizing the several ideas and thoughts that scream for my attention... the books that I start, at the same time... the ideas I explore, at the same time... the projects I start, at the same time... the multiple threads of work that I have at Loka, at the same time... 

This actually suits me because my mind craves multiple sources of... inspiration, curiosity, passion... I want to connect the dots between things and create something new... but it's hard with so many things calling for my attention.

I've tried setting time and allocate slots of time to focus on things, one at a time, but, frequently, when I try to follow "the plan", I end up trying my hardest to work on X when my mind is actually ready and eager to work on Y.

For example, I worked on a paper called the Antifragile Scientific Blockchain and I did it in a sprint of 3 days, with the help of ChatGPT. But I did it because I was laser focused on something that my mind and soul were inspired to shape and work in THAT moment.

I've heard someone say that when inspiration finds you and you don't act on it, then inspiration leaves you and goes find some other person ready to act on it.

What do you have to say about this?

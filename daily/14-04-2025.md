listening to the Theory That Wouldn't Die, chapter 11, which talks about 
predicting a nuclear accident.

It's interesting to see that even though the event to be predicted can 
have a catastrophic impact, the author nor the illustrious historical 
figures mentioned `ruin` as something worth measuring and being used for 
decision-making.

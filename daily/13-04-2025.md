# About Bayes Rule

David Hume	How can past experience justify future beliefs?		Bayesian inference updates beliefs probabilistically
Karl Popper	Science = falsification, not confirmation		Bayes allows degree of belief to shift (beyond 
boolean  - true or false)
Thomas Kuhn	Scientific paradigms shift, but how rationally?		Bayesian agents shift beliefs smoothly or abruptly

# Upgrading Bayes Rule with Ruin Exposure

Exploring how Bayes Rule is anti-fragile and fits really well the work I'm doing with the AntiSciChain.

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) x P(H)) / P(E)

Now, adding Ruin Exposure to this formula enables one to be aware of the cost of P(H|E) being wrong (if acted upon).

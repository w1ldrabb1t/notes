# GPT Conversation Companion
Create a project folder on GPT, to gather random conversations.

## Workflow
1. audio is recorded on the phone
2. audio is sent to Google Drive
3. Google Drive download to local folder
4. use OpenAI Whisper to transcribe
5. send transcription to GPT

I wish to automate this workflow... from step 2 onwards or at least from step 3.

## Details
If a conversation is focused on a particular project, then it should go to that project's vault of conversations instead.

## Questions

- What I want to get out of GPT regarding my conversations?

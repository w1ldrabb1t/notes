## fzf

fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

It's an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. 
It implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want.
